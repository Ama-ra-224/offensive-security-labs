# SMB Vulnerability Scanning using Enum4Linux

## Project Overview
This lab demonstrates how to perform SMB vulnerability scanning and enumeration using Nmap, Enum4Linux, and SMBClient. The objective is to discover live hosts, enumerate SMB users, shares, password policies, and test access permissions on exposed SMB shares.

---

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Enum4Linux
- SMBClient
- Nano

---

## Network Discovery

### Command
nmap -sN 172.17.0.0/24

### Explanation
This command performs a TCP NULL scan across the network to identify live hosts while attempting to evade basic firewall detection.

## SMB User Enumeration

### Command
enum4linux -U 172.17.0.2

### Explanation
This command enumerates user accounts available on the SMB service running on the target host.

## SMB Machine Enumeration

### Command
enum4linux -M 172.17.0.2

### Explanation
This command enumerates machine accounts registered on the SMB server.

## SMB Share Enumeration

### Command
enum4linux -S 172.17.0.2

### Explanation
This command lists all SMB shares exposed by the target system.

## Verbose Share Enumeration

### Command
enum4linux -Sv 172.17.0.2

### Explanation
This command performs detailed and verbose enumeration of SMB shares, revealing permissions and access levels.

## Password Policy Enumeration

### Command
enum4linux -P 172.17.0.2

### Explanation
This command retrieves the password policy configuration from the SMB server.

## Full SMB Enumeration

### Command
enum4linux -a 172.17.0.2

### Explanation
This command runs all available enumeration modules, including users, shares, groups, password policy, and OS information.

## Listing SMB Shares (Anonymous Access)

### Command
smbclient -L //172.17.0.2/

### Explanation
This command lists available SMB shares using anonymous authentication.

### Screenshot

## Accessing the print$ Share

### Command
smbclient //172.17.0.2/print$

### Explanation
This command attempts to connect to the print$ SMB share to test accessibility.

## Accessing the tmp Share

### Command
smbclient //172.17.0.2/tmp

### Explanation
This command connects to the tmp SMB share to test read and write permissions.

## Creating a Test File

### Command
nano virus.exe

### Explanation
This command creates a test file locally to verify whether file upload is possible on the SMB share.

### Screenshot

## Uploading File to SMB Share

### Command
put virus.exe group_work.txt

### Explanation
This command uploads the local file to the SMB share, confirming write access and potential misconfiguration.

### Screenshot

## Key Findings
- SMB services were accessible with little or no authentication
- User and password policy information was exposed
- Writable SMB shares present a serious security risk

---

## Conclusion
This lab highlights the importance of securing SMB services properly. Misconfigured SMB shares can lead to information disclosure and unauthorized file access. Implementing strong authentication, access controls, and disabling anonymous access are critical mitigation measures.
